# Who am I?
----------
I'm David Ochoa, a student studying at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am passionate about UI/UX Design and all other aspects of Front-End Development.

## What am I currently up to?
-----------
Currently, I am practicing and learning about Angular. I used Angular to create my portfolio along side other "mock" websites to hone my skills as a Front-End developer. I hope to be able to collaborate on projects in the future with like minded individuals who want to create artful websites.

What inspires me is that what we make as developers is art.
